Initiated in 2011 and continuing through to 2021, the survey has gathered data on personal happiness, well-being, and satisfaction with city services from a random sample of the cityâ€™s residents. This dataset has been instrumental in identifying and analyzing trends and factors that influence life satisfaction within the community over the years.
